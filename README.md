# Coder-Website---Web-Development-Fundamentals
This repository contains the code for a digital solution business "Coder" website built as part of the Web Development Fundamentals course by Coding Studio. The website is created using HTML and CSS, showcasing fundamental web development concepts such as structure, layout, and styling.

Below are the key features of this project:
1. Professional and Responsive Design:
CSS Flexbox and Grid are used for layout management, enabling a dynamic and fluid design that gives a professional and clean aesthetic. The layout for each section of the website is divided into columns for better visual organization, making it appealing and easy to navigate. The site is also built using media queries to ensure it is fully responsive: it adjusts layout elements based on the screen size, making it user-friendly across all devices, from mobile phones to large desktop screens.

2. Custom Navigation Bar:
A fixed navigation bar that remains at the top of the page as users scroll down, providing easy access to important sections of the website, such as About, Services, and Contact. The navigation bar links change color on hover, enhancing the user experience and accessibility.

3. Landing Section:
The homepage section a modern "jumbotron" section with an introductory text about Coder's services and a prominent call-to-action button encouraging users to explore more or contact the business.

4. About Section with Key Stats:
The about section features important statistics such as the number of experts, clients, and completed projects, using a grid layout to make the information clear and visually attractive. The statistics section adapts into a column and row display based on screen size to maintain readability and layout consistency.

5. Services Section:
Services offered by Coder are displayed in a grid format, with each service represented by an icon/image and a short description. This section helps visitors quickly understand the range of digital solutions available. The layout is designed for both aesthetic appeal and functionality, en suring that all key offerings are prominently displayed.

6. Contact Form: A simple contact form allows visitors to inquire about Coder's services, featuring fields for name, email, and message. The form layout is managed using CSS Grid and flexbox, ensuring proper alignment of form elements.

7. Interactive Call-to-Action Buttons and Forms: Prominent call-to-action (CTA) buttons are used throughout the website, such as "Get Started" or "Contact Us," designed with custom styles for emphasis. Hover effects and visual cues (like color changes) are applied to buttons and form items to make them stand out.

8. Google Maps Integration:  The Contact Us section includes an embedded Google Maps iframe, providing users with the business's physical location. This feature helps users easily find the business location.
